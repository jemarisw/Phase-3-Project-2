# Phase-3-Project-2

In this project, you’ll update Project 1 to make it even more useful! You’ll create a reusable movie component and display all search results instead of just the first one, and use a state manager to coordinate showing the components. You’ll also add the ability to add a movie to favorites, which will be loaded and displayed when the site loads. Finally, you’ll add the ability to let users leave a note attached to a movie which will be displayed whenever the movie is viewed.
